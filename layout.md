# Garden and tree layout plan
The backyard has many plants in it. This document is designed to explain what everything is, but is also for planning what should go where in the yard. To this end, there are two layouts: existing and planned.

There are many plants that were already present when I moved in which I don't intend to identify. However, new plants that I put in will be documented.

While the layout intends to be mostly to scale, the far east end of the yard may be elongated in order to better show the individual plants.
