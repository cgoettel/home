# Garden and tree layout
The backyard has many plants in it. This document is designed to explain what everything is. There are many plants that were already present when I moved in which I don't intend to identify. However, new plants that I put in will be documented.

While the layout intends to be mostly to scale, the far east end of the yard may be elongated in order to better show the individual plants.

## Raised garden beds
So far, only the southern raised bed exists, but the initial design allows for another identical bed to go just north of it.
