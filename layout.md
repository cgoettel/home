# Garden and tree layout plan
The yard has many plants in it. This document is designed to explain what everything is, but is also for planning so there are two layouts: existing and planned.

There are many plants that were already present when I moved in which I don't intend to identify (most are, though). However, new plants that I put in will be documented.
